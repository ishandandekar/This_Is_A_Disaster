# This_Is_A_Disaster

:wave: Hello and welcome to **This_Is_A_Disaster**. This is my first natural-language-processing project. Also, make sure to visit the official website of this project.

## Introduction

In this project, I try to classify tweets which are related to a natural disaster or not. I make an attempt on the **`nlp-getting-started`** competition available on Kaggle. Check the competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview). In this competition, we have to classify whether these tweets are about a natural disaster. I use neural networks, create models and try to improve on them using various layers and methods.
